<h2>What is AI writer?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The Cursed Banana A Short Story by Jane Doe John Hemingway looked at the cursed banana in his hands and felt puzzled. He walked over to the window and reflected on his cosy surroundings. He had always loved old-fashioned Skegness with its knobbly, kindhearted kettles. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel puzzled. Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Gregory Smith. Gregory was a lovable bear with spiky fingers and hairy hands. John gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a snotty, delightful, wine drinker with fragile fingers and handsome hands. His friends saw him as a bad, big banker. Once, he had even brought an uptight chicken back from the brink of death. But not even a snotty person who had once brought an uptight chicken back from the brink of death, was prepared for what Gregory had in store today. The sun shone like dancing elephants, making John irritable. As John stepped outside and Gregory came closer, he could see the nervous glint in his eye. "Look John," growled Gregory, with a helpful glare that reminded John of lovable goldfish. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a fight. You owe me 1177 gold pieces." John looked back, even more irritable and still fingering the cursed banana. "Gregory, I don't have the money," he replied. They looked at each other with healthy feelings, like two glamorous, greasy guppies smiling at a very courageous bar mitzvah, which had indie music playing in the background and two bold uncles smiling to the beat. John regarded Gregory's spiky fingers and hairy hands. "I don't have the funds ..." he lied. Gregory glared. "Do you want me to shove that cursed banana where the sun don't shine?" John promptly remembered his snotty and delightful values. "Actually, I do have the funds," he admitted. He reached into his pockets. "Here's what I owe you." Gregory looked fuzzy, his wallet blushing like a big, brainy banana. Then Gregory came inside for a nice glass of wine. THE END&nbsp;</p>
